# NCC CRUD Registration App

This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The app allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing NCC (National Cadet Corps) registrations.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing user registration data.
- **Express.js**: Node.js framework used for building the backend RESTful API.
- **React**: JavaScript library used for building the frontend user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for server-side development.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling tool used for interacting with the MongoDB database.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client used for making AJAX requests from React to the backend API.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register for NCC by providing necessary details such as email, username, and password.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using Passport.js or JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can perform CRUD operations to manage NCC registrations, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting registrations.
- **Flash Messages**: Displaying flash messages to provide feedback to users after successful or failed operations.
- **Form Validation**: Client-side and server-side form validation to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Responsive Design**: Responsive user interface that works seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
